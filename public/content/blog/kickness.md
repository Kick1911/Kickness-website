# The Kickness Project
## Background

This is my mission to popularize the C language.


It begins with me introducing myself to the C language in undergrade studies.
For some reason I was interested in the language even though I have only done Java and Python prior. I quickly fell in love with the C language. I would have loved to get a job coding in C, but unfortunately those jobs do not exist (well, not in my country at least).

I want this project to be kickstart C development in this world. I believe C is the best language ever made and it needs to be recognized.


## Projects
### [#Unitest](https://github.com/Kick1911/unitest)
The first project I have created. It is a Unit test framework for C. It is meant to be easy to use and pleasing to the eye. It is written as one header file and strictly in C preprocessor code (simply because I wanted to).
