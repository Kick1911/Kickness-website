# The Kickness Project
## Background

This is my mission to popularize the C language.


It begins with me introducing myself to the C language in undergrade studies.
For some reason I was interested in the language even though I have only done Java and Python prior. I quickly fell in love with the C language. I would have loved to get a job coding in C, but unfortunately those jobs do not exist (well, not in my country at least).

I want this project to be kickstart C development in this world. I believe C is the best language ever made and it needs to be recognized.


## Projects
### [#Unitest](https://github.com/Kick1911/unitest)
The first project I have created. It is a Unit test framework for C. It is meant to be easy to use and pleasing to the eye. It is written as one header file and strictly in C preprocessor code (simply because I wanted to).

### TODO:[#HTTP Framework](https://github.com/Kick1911)
Many of those whom have studied Computer Science or some qualification in the programming field will get
a job as a backend web developer or with backend included in their work. Since I know this and also know
the C language is never used to develop HTTP servers directly, I want to create a C framework that
will allow development of HTTP servers in C with ease. I mean all HTTP servers deal with is string
manipulation, so there is no reason why we shouldn't be doing this in a programming language with
one of the best string manipulation capabilities.

### TODO:[#Package Manager](https://github.com/Kick1911)
Some type of package manager which pulls source code from a cloud repo and plugs into the project.
- The source will then be included into your compile line.
- These packages need to be all inclusive.
- This is an extension of the Project builer.

### TODO:[#Project builder](https://github.com/Kick1911)
One of the most difficult things when you start C programming is:
- How to structure your project
- Dealing with the Builder e.g. Makefile, autoconf, cmake, etc.

My goal here is to make a highly scalable project builder to improve
the quality of life for new C programmers.
